After a couple days worth of research, he realized that it can be a great way to start investing and accumulate wealth: but he wasn’t at the legal age yet to trade or buy any crypto. So he decided to focus on Options Trading within the stock market with a papertrading account till he realized its potential as well. This is the moment when he realized something: Technical Analysis (TA) is important. He would spend his time with his discord friends who had experience in analyzing charts trying to figure out simple ways to make sense of the movements. It took him some time, but at the end, he figured it out. Since he still wasn’t at a legal age at that time either, he simply stopped trading options. At the age of 17, he made his first purchase during the COVID market crash and invested his time into Web3/Crypto Trading since then."
